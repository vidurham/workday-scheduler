# Work Day Scheduler

An interactive app that allows you to schedule your workday. The app uses Moment.js to give real time to your workday planner, changing colors of your planning blocks throughout the day. It also uses jQuery to save what you have planned at the click of a button. It does this through using LocalStorage on the computer.
